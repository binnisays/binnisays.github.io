The Yeddyurappa government has ordered the cancellation of the Tipu Jayanti celebrations in Karnataka following the voter turnout. The Congress responded that the BJP government's decision was communal.

In 2015, Tipu Sultan Jayanti celebrated its anniversary with the Congress government led by Siddaramaiah. The BJP has been in opposition since then, accusing it of being a minority appeasement. Two people were killed in communal clashes in Kodagu in 2016 as part of Tipu Jayanti celebrations.

The Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa decided not to celebrate Tipu Jayanthi. The Chief Minister said that the decision was in line with the demand of Uttarakhand MLAs. The Culture Department also issued a circular informing them that the celebration was canceled. The festival is held every year in November. The celebration is scheduled for November 10.
