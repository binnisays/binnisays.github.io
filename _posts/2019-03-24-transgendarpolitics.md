Transgender activist Bharathi Kannamma donned the avatar of Goddess Meenakshi as she filed her nomination for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from Madurai.

Earlier, Kannamma had expressed apprehensions regarding the date chosen for polling in Tamil Nadu, as it coincides with an annual festival of transgender people.
