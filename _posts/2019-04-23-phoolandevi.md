    Rana, who is out on bail since October 2016, had boasted that he murdered Phoolan to avenge the 1981 Behmai massacre in which 28 Rajputs were gunned down.
    He even claims to have brought back the remains of Prithviraj Chouhan from Afghanistan where he was hiding after escaping from Tihar jail.SAPAKS says it is fielding Rana, a Rajput, because big parties have always ignored Thakur and Rajput communities while handing out tickets for Indore.

However, SAPAKS will have to cross several legal hurdles before it can field Rana since he has been convicted of murder. “A person can contest elections if the conviction has been stayed by court. However, if the court has granted a suspension of sentence, the person cannot contest elections since the conviction persists,” advocate Vivek Dalal said.
