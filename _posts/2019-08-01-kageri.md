Bengaluru: BJP's Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri has been elected as the Speaker of the Karnataka Assembly. Kageri was unanimously elected by the Legislative Council.

Vishweshwar is a legislator from Sirsi in the Uttara Kannada district. This is the sixth time he has been elected to the legislature. He was also the Speaker of the Assembly during 1994-99. Vishweshwar entered politics through the Congress in 1978.

The resignation of Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar has come to light after Yeddyurappa's BJP government won the confidence vote. This is why the BJP has named Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri as its speaker.
