India chief justice accuser quits inquiry .The ruling comes days after a woman who accused Mr Gogoi withdrew from the inquiry after questioning its fairness.

The woman, a former Supreme Court employee, alleged that two instances of misconduct took place in October - the month Mr Gogoi was sworn in as chief justice.  An internal committee says the sexual harassment claims against Ranjan Gogoi had "no substance".
