To knock down BJP in 2019 Loksabha elections, Bahujan Samaj Party and
Samajwadi Party has made a pre poll alliance. This is the third pre-poll alliance by
the BSP â€” the first in 1993 with the SP and later in 1996 with the Congress for UP
Assembly elections. This is the first pre-poll alliance it has struck for Lok Sabha
polls.The BJP would no longer get the benefit of division of votes and reap rich
political dividends as it got in 2014 Lok Sabha elections and later in UP polls. The
coming together of the SP and BSP also poses a challenge before the BJP to prevent
the arithmetic from turning into chemistry and to prevent the non-Jatavs, who had
overwhelmingly voted for the BJP in 2014 and 2017 elections, from returning to
the BSP fold.If BSP-SP alliance wins then it is sure that Mayawati will be the PM
and AKhilesh will be the CM of Uttar Pradesh
