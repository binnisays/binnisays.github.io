Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman ─ known as MBS for short ─ is paying his first state visit to Pakistan since becoming the heir to the throne in 2017. The purpose of the prince's two-day visit — which was originally scheduled for February 16 but began on February 17 — is to wrap up a series of multi-billion dollar deals with Pakistan in various sectors.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ARRIVED in Pakistan on Sunday at the start of his tour of South Asia and China, but the visit risks being overshadowed by escalating tensions between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan.

The trip comes days after a suicide bomber killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama. New Delhi has accused Pakistan of having a hand in the bombing and vowed to punish Islamabad, which denies involvement.Cash-strapped and in need of friends, Pakistan is welcoming the crown prince with open arms for a visit during which he is expected to sign investment agreements worth more than $10 billion.


Saudi Arabia has in recent months helped keep Pakistan's economy a float by propping up its rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves with a $6 billion loan, giving Islamabad breathing room as it negotiates a bailout with the International Monetary Fund.Pakistani officials have already flagged up that Saudi Arabia will announce eight investment agreements, including a $10 billion refinery and petrochemicals complex in the coastal city of Gwadar, where China is building a port.

But the crown prince's arrival comes amid a vow by India to isolate Pakistan internationally following the deadliest attack in Kashmir in decades.
