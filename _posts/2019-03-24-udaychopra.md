Uday Chopra has had a rough couple of years in Bollywood. Though he tasted success with Mohabbatein and later the Dhoom franchise, he hasn't been able to find a strong footing in the industry.

Despite this, the actor regales his fans with his entertaining tweets. Yet, recently, he posted some tweets, hinting at depression and suicide. He wrote, "For a few hours, I De-activated my twitter account. It felt as close to death as I could get. Was phenomenal! I think this is a good good option to suicide. I might be doing it permanently soon."

Later he added, "Confession- I am not ok! I am trying but so far I'm failing."

Later, Uday Chopra deleted the tweets and went back to tweeting about atheism.
