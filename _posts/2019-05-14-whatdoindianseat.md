  The vegetarian food that Indians ate was mainly wheat flatbreads or a kind of flatbread made out of chickpeas, with a spicy vegetarian sauce with lentils, and yogurt. Or people ate rice, with yogurt and vegetables. India believes in sharing so there is a possibility that they will order a curry and share it with you. Usually in European countries everyone has their own portion of curries .
  
  Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), tuer (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and moong (mung beans).
  
   Indians typically create saucy curries to serve over rice with flatbread or puppadams, which they dip into the sauce. For example, a popular Punjabi dish, dal mahkni, is a butter-based lentil dish served over rice. Another popular meal is curry chicken, which consists of a tomato-based sauce.
   
   Streets in Old Delhi are immensely popular for succulent kababs, greesy paranthas, crispy golgappas, syrupy jalebis, and lip-smacking chaat. Influenced by North Indian cuisine such as chhole bhature and rajma chawal, the capital city offers more than one can put on their plate.
