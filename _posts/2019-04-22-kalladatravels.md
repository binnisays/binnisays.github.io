The Maradu police have now arrested three of the staff – Jayesh, Girilal, and Jithin – for assaulting the passengers. A case has been registered under Indian Penal Code sections 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 294(b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

The two victims are now receiving treatment at a private hospital in Coimbatore. Both of them have sustained injuries in their arms, legs, and head.
