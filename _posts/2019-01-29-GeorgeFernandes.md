Former Union defence minister George Fernandes passed away at the age of 88 on Tuesday morning following a prolonged illness, his family sources said.

Fernandes was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Recently, he contracted swine flu, they said.

Fernandes held the defence ministry portfolio from 2001 to 2004 under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government. Apart from defence, he also held the portfolios of communications, industry and railways under various governments.

As a defence minister, Fernandes oversaw the Pokhran nuclear tests of 1998 and the Kargil war in 1999. He was also famous for taking frequent trips to the Siachen glacier to look after the well being of the soldiers deployed there and providing facilities such as snow scooters to them cutting down the bureaucracy of his ministry.
