This  mystery remained a secret behind the most horrific terrorist attack in Sri Lanka after the ten years of Civil War.

Although the so-called Islamic State has acknowledged the responsibility of these attacks on its media portal 'Amak', but it can not be confirmed because, after the Islamic State attacks, generally publishes photographs of the attackers and accepts responsibility for the attacks immediately.

There is no evidence that the claims made after three of the Sri Lankan attacks are true.

The Sri Lankan government has taken the name of a local jehadi faction - National Towheed Jamaat - and officials have talked about the bombing with the help of an international network.

CCTV footage aired by a local Sri Lankan channel shows one of the alleged suicide bombers entering the St Sebastian Church in Negombo, moments before a blast ripped through the church during the Easter Sunday mass.
The church in Negombo, just over 40 minutes from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, was among the eight places where a string of explosions killed over 300 people and injured several hundreds.
