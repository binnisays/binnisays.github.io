 Newly-appointed Central Bureau of Investigation chief Rishi Kumar Shukla on Monday took over the reins of the probe agency. The 1983-batch IPS officer took charge at a time when the CBI is busy in a dirty battle of a turf war with the Kolkata Police over questioning of its Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar over a Ponzi scheme scam. 

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been staging a dharna in Kolkata since Sunday evening against the Centre's alleged high-handedness.

The government had appointed the former Madhya Pradesh Director General of Police as CBI director on Saturday despite a dissent note from Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge.

Shukla (58) was appointed as the CBI chief 20 days after Alok Verma was removed unceremoniously from the post following his bitter feud with Special Director Rakesh Asthana.
