Air India has ordered a “full inquiry” in the incident where President Ram Nath Kovind’s Air India One flight was delayed at Zurich on Sunday after the plane developed a technical snag, reported news agency ANI.

The Boeing 747 aircraft was scheduled to fly the President from Zurich to Slovenia.

The President’s departure from Switzerland to Slovenia was delayed for about three hours on Sunday after his Air India One faced a technical glitch at the Zurich airport.

The President drove to the airport but was asked to return to his hotel after a ‘Rudder Fault’ was detected in the aircraft.
