Amit Shah’s tweet on ‘Hindi Diwas’ that a common language would become “the mark of India’s identity globally” had sparked a firestorm of protest in South India.


Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday derided Union home minister Amit Shah’s push for Hindi as India’s national language as “a new battlefield in the name of language.”

“Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s Hindi agenda push despite nationwide protest needs to be seen as Sangh Parivar’s signs to launch a new battlefield in the name of language. The perception that only Hindi can unite the country is completely wrong. People in the south and the north-east don’t speak Hindi,” Vijayan wrote in a Facebook post.
