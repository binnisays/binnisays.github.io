Congress president Rahul Gandhi will hold two rallies in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday to campaign for his party's Lok Sabha poll candidates in the state.

He will address a public meeting in Shahdol district between 3 pm and 4 pm and later hold another rally at Sehora town in Jabalpur district, Congress' state unit general secretary Rajiv Singh said.

The Shahdol constituency is reserved for candidates belonging to Scheduled Tribes while the Jabalpur Lok Sabha seat is open for the general category.

The Congress has fielded Pramila Singh from Shahdol against BJP's Himadri Singh, who quit the Gandhi-led outfit in the run-up to the polls to join the saffon outfit.
