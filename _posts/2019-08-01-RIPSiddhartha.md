The body of VG Siddhartha, the founder of the famous coffee shop chain Cafe Coffee Day, was discovered by the Indian Navy and the Karnataka Police after a massive search at Netravati River. The rumors surrounding his disappearance ceased. Siddhartha was thrown into a deep depression when his dream empire collapsed. 

But those who knew him would say that Siddhartha was not one to lose his heart in defeat. Siddhartha was eighteen years old when he received his first defeat of his life. In the year 1978 he failed in the first attempt in the admission test to the National Defense Academy, a training institute for Indian military officers. Siddhartha wanted to be a military officer fighting for the motherland. Addressing the students of Kanpur IT in 2016, he said that the biggest tragedy of his life was not being able to pass that exam. 

He did not give up on that defeat. He went straight to St. Aloysius College, a 140-year-old college in Mangalore. From that college, Siddhartha learned the basics of economics. He left with a Masters Degree in Economics.

He studied economics and became acquainted with Karl Marx. At one time, he would have been leading the Communist Party. But he learned one thing from studying the history of the Russian Communist Party. The parties that came to power on the basis of ideology soon put him in the tragedy of disregarding the core of those principles. 

His last years of college were in the eighties. At that time, Siddhartha thought like a Robin Hood how to divide the rich and distribute to the poor. He realized how difficult it is to make money in this poor country. 

He was the only heir to a coffee plantation in Chikmagalur, India, with 130 years of tradition. Yet, Siddhartha did not look back to his father's business for some time. His interest was in the stock exchanges on Dalal Street. He continued to live in Mumbai until 1985 and returned to his homeland that year. That return was determined to help his father in business and thrive. They have been cultivating coffee since the 1870s, and have since grown to over 300 acres of coffee plantations. 



Siddhartha was not ready to take over his father's estate. Instead, he borrowed Rs 7 lakh from his father as capital for his future business dreams. He came to Bengaluru with the money and opened an office there. He re-invested in the share market, concentrating on that office. The goal was to raise money for his future work in the coffee market. Siddhartha made a profit of Rs 1-2 lakh per day utilizing the existing loopholes in the stock market. With the money he received, he began to buy orchards beyond his father's coffee plantations. By 1991, Siddhartha owned almost 5,000 acres of coffee plantation.
