Uttar Pradesh Election updates - Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav will contest from Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh, which was represented by his father Mulayam Singh Yadav.

While the 79-year-old SP patriarch will contest from "safe seat" Mainpuri this time, his name was conspicuously missing from the list of 40 star campaigners of the party released here on Sunday.
