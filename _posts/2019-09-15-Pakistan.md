 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said there was no question of talking to New Delhi after it revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, as he warned about the possibility of a conventional war with India which could go beyond the subcontinent.
"So that's why we have approached the United Nations, we are approaching every international forum, that they must act right now," he said.
Khan said he "absolutely" believes war with India could be a possibility.
